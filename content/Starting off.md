It all started one evening when i was bored out of my mind. With the current COVID-19 situation, i was mostly spending my days in isolation not really working on any projects other than obligatory university deliverables. 6 months prior to starting this project, i had tried making a game in unity, but ultimately ended up scrapping it. However, in the process i learned the basics of blender and also learned to rig and animate a basic character.

That night, i got an urge to do something creative, and the idea started with a unique concept: blending cyberpunk and standard fantasy environments. 

However silly it may be, I called it: <b>Cyber-Nature.</b>

Staying faithful to using only low-poly, basic geometry to make my characters, i gave my shot at making a companion character. I had recently played Remedy's Control, and was inspired to make a character design based on "The Board" or the inverted pyramid.

At last i put all i had created in a scene, and made a quick render!

With a newfound confidence in the project, i was ready for diving into Unreal Engine 4.
