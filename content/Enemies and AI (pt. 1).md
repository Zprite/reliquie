# Enemies and AI (pt. 1)

Ok, we have movement and basic combat down, time to make some enemies! Sooo, i decided to make a flying type enemy. Yep, not a basic grounded enemy but a flying one... Well, at least i really get to know how to make complex AI with this one...

## Crow mesh

To start with, I wanted to make my own low-poly crow mesh, but after some hours, I decided to get a crow character from the Unreal asset store. Instead i created a custom mask for the crow to make it fit more in with my art style. This way, I saved myself a crap-ton of work modeling, rigging and animating. So i whipped up a quick draft in Blender to convince myself that this would work:

## AI and behavior

Now for the not-so easy part, the flying AI character. This was totally new to me so i was blessed when i found there was two quite good tutorial series on the UE4 AI and behavior systems (link at the bottom). This way i had a chance to know what the hell i was supposed to do and get me going. I seriously can't thank these guys enough. After one night with experimenting and watching tutorials i had a semi-working roaming sequence for the flying AI.

Now i just have to make the AI less stupid, and make a attack sequence!
